Join practitioners, thought leaders, and corporate decision-makers from across the cloud native serverless landscape at the Serverless Practitioners Summit, the day prior to KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe 2020.The goal of the Summit is to unite the serverless and cloud native community and present end users with the critical strategic, business, and operational contexts driving rapid innovation in this space. 
The day will be structured in two parts, with the first being a single-track survey of the serverless landscape. The second half of the single-track day will provide a series of breakouts featuring more immersive, project-focused material, as well as additional community discussion.
