As Helm v2 support comes to an end in November 2020, join the Helm maintainers for a free half day hands-on workshop. We’ll be covering what’s in Helm 3, Helm 3 migration best practices, tips and tricks, and more!
Who Should Attend: Any Application Developer, Systems/Embedded Developer, and DevOps/SRE/Sysadmin Architect who currently use Helm 2 to write/deploy/maintain applications.
