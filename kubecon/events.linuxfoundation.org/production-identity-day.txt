That’s a wrap on Production Identity Day: SPIFFE + SPIRE at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2020! We welcomed over 500 attendees from 37 countries – thank you to all the attendees, sponsors and speakers that joined us virtually this year. 
All session recordings will be uploaded to the CNCF YouTube channel in early December.
Save the Date for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2021!
We hope you join us virtually May 4-7, 2021.

We are excited to host the first Production Identity Day at KubeCon to share learnings around the latest developments in the space, exhibit demonstrations, and discuss real-world use cases with others who share an interest in identity, authentication, and zero trust security.
