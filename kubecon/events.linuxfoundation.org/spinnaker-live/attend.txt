						Code of Conduct					





The Linux Foundation and its project communities are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events, whether they are held in person or virtually. Linux Foundation events are working conferences intended for professional networking and collaboration within the open source community. They exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at Linux Foundation events or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form.
This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by The Linux Foundation and the terms are non-negotiable. Your registration for or attendance at any Linux Foundation event, whether it’s held in person or virtually, indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its terms.


Expected Behavior
All event participants, whether they are attending an in-person event or a virtual event, are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior and applicable laws.


Unacceptable Behavior
Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, whether in person or virtually, including, but not limited to, harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held. Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors. Any report of harassment at one of our events, whether in person or virtual, will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a conference organizer at once.
Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their booths and must refrain from the use of sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or otherwise creating a sexualized environment. Speakers should not use sexual language, images, or any language or images that would constitute harassment as defined above in their talks.
Individuals who participate (or plan to participate) in Linux Foundation events, whether its an in-person event or a virtual event, should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that comports with both the letter and spirit of this policy prohibiting harassment and abusive behavior, whether before, during or after the event.  This includes statements made in social media postings, on-line publications, text messages, and all other forms of electronic communication.


Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, whether in person or virtually, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate depending on the circumstances, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the conference with no refund. The Linux Foundation reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further Linux Foundation events, trainings or other activities.
If a participant (or individual wishing to participate in a Linux Foundation event, in-person and/or virtual), through postings on social media or other online publications or another form of electronic communication, engages in conduct that violates this policy, whether before, during or after a Linux Foundation event, The Linux Foundation may take appropriate corrective action, which could include imposing a temporary or permanent ban on an individual’s participation in future Linux Foundation events.


What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. You are also encouraged to contact Colleen Mickey, Director of Event Services, at cmickey@linuxfoundation.org. 


Incident Response
Our staff has taken incident response training and responds to harassment reports quickly and thoroughly. As referenced above, if a participant engages in harassing behavior, whether in-person or virtually, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the conference with no refund, depending on the circumstances. The Linux Foundation reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further Linux Foundation events, trainings or other activities.
Conference staff will also provide support to victims, including, but not limited to:
