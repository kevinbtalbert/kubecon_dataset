As the power industry enters a new digital age, open source development processes are at the top of everyone’s mind. LF Energy and the Linux Foundation have teamed with Dutch distribution system operator, Alliander, to provide a full day of training that leverages best practices for open source software within the enterprise. Ibrahim Haddad, open source scholar & practitioner and Executive Director of LF AI, is joined by Jon Aldama, co-founder of FOSSID, along with Executive Director of LF Energy, Shuli Goodman.  The event has been designed for utilities and their suppliers/vendors. The venue is at Alliander’s campus in Duiven, just minutes from Arnhem, The Netherlands on February 6, 2020. 
This day of open source instruction includes details on developing software in an open source environment, business strategy, license compliance, and managing an open source program office within your organization. The event is provided free of charge to encourage utility professionals to send entire teams to come and learn about the collaborative development methods that are shaping the energy industry of the future. We hope to see you there.
