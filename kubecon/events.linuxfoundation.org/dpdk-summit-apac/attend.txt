Education and collaboration are vital to the future of the DPDK community, and it is imperative to us that everyone in the community that wants to participate feels welcome to do so regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, dis/ability, race, ethnicity, age, religion or economic status. The Linux Foundation code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
