Overview

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a fast, efficient, and portable binary instruction format for programming languages, providing an embeddable and safe execution environment for platform extensions. Started in 2015, Wasm became a popular way to extend web applications and is gaining momentum for server side and cloud native applications as well. 
Join us for a day of discussion and to learn more about the intersection of cloud native and web assembly.
The intent of this day is to provide a vendor neutral space for collaboration and sharing of the intersection of cloud native and web assembly.  Proposals including proprietary solutions or commercial product offerings will not be accepted.

Important Notes

All speakers are required to adhere to our Code of Conduct. We also highly recommend that speakers take our Inclusive Speaker Orientation Course.Complimentary Passes For Speakers – One complimentary pass for the event will be provided per submission. Avoid sales or marketing pitches and discussing unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies when preparing your proposal; these talks are almost always rejected due to the fact that they take away from the integrity of our events, and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.All accepted speakers are required to submit their slides by April 7.



Preparing to Submit

Preparing to Submit Your Proposal
While it is not our intention to provide you with strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal, we hope you will take a moment to review the following guidelines that we have put together to help you prepare the best submission possible. To get started, here are three things that you should consider before submitting your proposal:
What are you hoping to get from your presentation?What do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?How will your presentation help better the ecosystem?
There are plenty of ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts. Remember the things to consider that we mentioned above when writing your proposal and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees while still letting you share your experiences, educate the community about an issue, or generate interest in a project.
First Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated
Linux Foundation events are an excellent way to get to know the community and share your ideas and the work that you are doing and we strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events. In the instance that you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be more than happy to work with you on your proposal.
How To Give a Great Tech Talk
In the instance that your talk is accepted, we want to make sure that you give the best presentation possible. To do this, we enlisted the help of seasoned conference speaker Josh Berkus who has prepared an in-depth tutorial on “How to Give a Great Tech Talk”.
