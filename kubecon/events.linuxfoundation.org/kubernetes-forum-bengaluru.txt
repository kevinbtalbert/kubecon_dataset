February 17, 2020Manpho Convention Centre
Bengaluru, India#K8sForum



Kubernetes Forum Bengaluru 2020 is a wrap! Thank you to all the attendees and sponsors who joined us in Bengaluru this year. To experience the best of this year’s event, be sure to watch session recordings, view photos, and review session slides from speakers that provided them via the event schedule.


Kubernetes Forums connect international and local cloud native experts, adopters, developers, and end users in global cities to enable face-to-face collaboration and deliver rich educational experiences. Engage with the leaders of Kubernetes and other CNCF-hosted projects as we set the direction for the cloud native ecosystem. Kubernetes Forums have both a beginner and an advanced track; about half of the speakers are international experts and half are from the local area.
