				RISC-V Forums			







RISC-V Forums bring together the community with RISC-V experts for 3 hours of deep-dive presentations, hands-on learning, and networking with technical enthusiasts in the RISC-V ecosystem.
Four events, each on a specific topic. Join one, join them all, learn, expand your knowledge, and meet your colleagues in the RISC-V community!


Vectors are used extensively in machine learning algorithms to process data sets and arrays. At this event, organizations will share the latest algorithms, developments and research on machine learning with RISC-V. The community will also present on the latest vector extension progress and custom extensions used in machine learning applications. Attend to see the latest on devices, development tools, optimized instructions and other ecosystem development for machine learning.

Embedded technology is the heart of RISC-V due to the flexible and adaptable architecture. In this event, expect to hear about code optimization, Embedded ABI (EABI), packed-simd, and fast interrupts. You will also hear about RISC-V embedded technologies in the automotive industry, medical equipment, communications, graphic cards, and in disk drives.

In 2021, RISC-V has many exciting things happening in the Security area. Two extensions will be ratified this year – trusted execution and crypto scaler. At this event, we will cover the latest trends on security, how people are using the tools in the RISC-V ecosystem, and how you can get involved and use the tools.
