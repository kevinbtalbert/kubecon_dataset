About Palm Springs
Nestled at the base of the majestic San Jacinto Mountains, the City of Palm Springs is the ancestral home of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. The streets, lined with palm trees, are perfect for exploring boutique shops, art galleries, and museums while soaking up the warm sunshine. The Rat Pack lived, loved and played here…stars such as Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, and Lucille Ball all built homes here (that you can now rent!), adding a touch of stardust.
