						Call for Proposals (CFP)					





The Call for Proposals is now closed.
LSF/MM/BPF is an invitation-only technical workshop to map out improvements to the Linux storage, filesystem, BPF, and memory management subsystems that will make their way into the mainline kernel within the coming years.
This year’s event will be a three-day, stand-alone conference with four subsystem-specific tracks, cross-track discussions, as well as BoF and hacking sessions. 
Proposals for agenda topics should be sent to the following lists to allow for discussion among your peers. This will help us figure out which topics are important for the agenda.
    lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

and CC the mailing lists that are relevant for the topic in question:
    FS:     linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org
    MM:     linux-mm@kvack.org
    Block:  linux-block@vger.kernel.org
    ATA:    linux-ide@vger.kernel.org
    SCSI:   linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
    NVMe:   linux-nvme@lists.infradead.org
    BPF:    bpf@vger.kernel.org

Please tag your proposal with [LSF/MM/BPF TOPIC] to make it easier to track. In addition, please make sure to start a new thread for each topic rather than following up on an existing one. Agenda topics and attendees will be selected by the program committee, but the final agenda will be formed by consensus of the attendees on the day.
