						Child Care					







We are offering complimentary onsite child care this year. Children (as well as professional child care providers) must be fully vaccinated to participate. Fully vaccinated is defined as two weeks (14 full days) after the final dose of a vaccine approved for emergency or full use by the WHO. Proof of vaccination will be required. We apologize that we are unable to accommodate children who are not vaccinated, even those that are not currently old enough to be vaccinated, due to safety and liability concerns. 
Event in-person health and safety requirements must also be followed, which currently includes wearing masks (except while eating & drinking). 
To sign up, please complete the RSVP form by 12:00am PDT on April 4, 2022. 
Please note, we can only provide childcare to those who RSVP by the deadline. Due to staffing and licensing restrictions, we are unable to accommodate late or onsite sign-ups. 
If you need any additional details, please email us at events@linuxfoundation.org.
