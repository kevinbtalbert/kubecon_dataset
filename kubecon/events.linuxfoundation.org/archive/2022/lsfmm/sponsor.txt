Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management & BPF Summit gathers the foremost development and research experts and kernel subsystem maintainers to map out and implement improvements to the Linux filesystem, storage, and memory management subsystems that will find their way into the mainline kernel and Linux distributions in the next 24 – 48 months.
This three-day invitation-only workshop is a community event underwritten and managed by The Linux Foundation. A nomination process takes place annually in order to decide which 85 people will be invited to attend in the coming year.
Sponsoring this event not only showcases your company’s support of those developers and researchers at the forefront of important innovations in these spaces; it also offers a coveted seat at the table at the event allowing a member of your organization the opportunity to watch and affect change at the ground level.
