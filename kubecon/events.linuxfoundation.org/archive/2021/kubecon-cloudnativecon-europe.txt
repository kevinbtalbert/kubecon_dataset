Awesome ongoing talk on "Panel: Your Path To Non-code Contribution In The Kubernetes Community" by @Dixie3Flatline, @mbbroberg, @inductor__, @kaslinfields at @KubeCon_ + @CloudNativeFdn Conference. Thank you very much for clearing a path for a beginner in the world of Kubernetes. pic.twitter.com/q6tf9xMgzH— Kaiwalya Koparkar (@kaiwalya_13) May 5, 2021




I'm learning so much here! 🤩I love the part about ~"One must ask oneself if open sourcing a project will create value or diminish value" https://t.co/LIIH62t44A— Jessica Andersson @ KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU (@solidtubez) May 7, 2021






"An injustice ignored is an injustice condoned"- @aevavoom absolutely rockin it with @MrBobbyTables showing that the @CloudNativeFdn is a welcoming place that will not sit idly by in the face of bigotry, oppression, and marginalization. THANK YOU! pic.twitter.com/CCyoLHq6yH— "Birthmark" Bart Farrell (@birthmarkbart) May 7, 2021




So, I originally planned to attend a lot of talks of #KubeCon today, and ended up with a lot of @CloudNativeFdn projects "Office Hours" instead : @crossplane_io , @CloudEventsIO , @HelmPack , etc. These are essentially "build you own talk by asking questions".  That's SO cool ❤️ pic.twitter.com/8y8LUk7jXf— Alexis "Horgix" Chotard (@Horgix) May 5, 2021




Hey!  #kubecon has live transcription!  Way to go, @CloudNativeFdn!— Berkubernetus (@fuzzychef) May 5, 2021




One of the best things about pre-recorded talks at virtual conferences is the creativity it allows people to express while teaching you something. @ellenkorbes and @TabbySable were a fantastic example of that today, truly incredible.— Kat Cosgrove (@Dixie3Flatline) May 6, 2021
