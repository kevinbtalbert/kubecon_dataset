FAQ + Contact

What is a hybrid event? Our hybrid event is an in-person event with a virtual component for those that cannot attend in person. We will take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of those who attend the event in person. We are evaluating virtual components and will be excited to share details as they become available. Given the fluid COVID-19 situation, this may change, and we may need to once again pivot from a hybrid event to a virtual event.
What is the value of participating in this event?We believe everyone will find value in joining us for the high-quality content that is expected from a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon event. Our open source communities inspire us to be resilient – to adapt and thrive with speed and consideration, immersed in the goal of bringing together a distributed group of people from around the globe. It’s in the DNA of the open source community to connect, learn and collaborate, therefore, what better place to do so than one of the premier open source developer conferences in the world?
What happens if the event can’t be held in-person?Given the fluid COVID-19 situation, we may need to pivot from a hybrid event to a virtual event once again. We will make the decision and notify all participants at least 3 months in advance. Sponsors will, at that time, be presented with the new virtual event sponsorship pricing and benefits, and will have 14 days to choose whether to transfer their sponsorship to the virtual event, apply a credit to a future CNCF event in 2022 or receive a full refund.
When will access to the sponsor portal (ERC) be provided? We are looking to provide access to confirmed sponsors by mid-summer so you can get started on planning your deliverables. Our sponsor services team will be in touch with updates as we get closer to the event. 
What information will be provided in the leads report that sponsors receive? Included in sponsor reports are the names, job titles, company names, email addresses, and physical work addresses (if provided) of all attendees who visited the sponsor’s booth space and got their name badge scanned. Phone numbers will not be shared. More information on lead reporting will be provided in the sponsor portal.
Will a breakdown of attendees be provided to sponsors?We will share a list of attending companies with all sponsors twice prior to the event. This list will include the company names only but no contact information. After the event, all sponsors will receive a detailed transparency report with overall attendee statistics and demographics, event highlights and media coverage. Attendee contact information will not be shared.
What is your policy for sharing attendee information?The Linux Foundation’s data protection and privacy policy is part of our general terms and conditions that all registrants must accept before they can complete their registration. This includes the registrant’s confirmation that they understand their data will be shared with the sponsor if they have their name badge scanned at a sponsor booth. All Linux Foundation events are GDPR compliant. For more information, please see The Linux Foundation’s Privacy Policy. 
Who should I contact with further questions?Please email sponsor@cncf.io to discuss sponsorship opportunities.
