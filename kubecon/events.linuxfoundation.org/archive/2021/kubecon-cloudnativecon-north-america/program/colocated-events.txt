Do you need to select the right technologies to build your next application? Get your hands dirty with those technologies before you start your build. Learn how Kubernetes and Istio give you full control over your microservices. Kubernetes minimizes outages and disruptions through self-healing, intelligent scheduling, horizontal scaling, and load balancing. Istio gives you security, advanced routing, policy, and insights into your application. Our developers will walk you through the step-by-step in this Hands-on-Lab, and you’ll walk away with a certification badge.

Advanced Kubernetes Troubleshooting Made Simple with Open Source Tools hosted by Replicated – IN-PERSON SOLD OUT (Waitlist Available)
Date: Tuesday, October 12, 2021 | Time: 11:30 AM – 1:30 PM PDTLocation: Room 402AB + Virtual | Registration Fees: Complimentary

As engineers, operators, and administrators, we grapple with vexing and expensive problems. Support bottlenecks caused by technical language barriers, differing time zones, incomplete information, and other typically minor issues can extend the time between identifying an issue and resolving it by hours or even days. Fortunately, a fully open source toolset available called Troubleshoot can drastically reduce the time between diagnosis and solution. This lightweight, fully customizable Kubernetes plugin consists of two parts – preflight and support-bundle. Troubleshoot is capable of collecting, analyzing, and packaging the data needed to get and keep your cluster operating at peak functionality. If it sounds too good to be true, just wait – it gets even better. 
Join our live lab to see tiny-yet-mighty troubleshoot.sh in action in a live demo, plus the opportunity to learn how to customize troubleshoot components to fit your needs.
Some background info: 
Attendees will be provided with instructions on how to log into a Linux Host running a Kubernetes Application. Attendees will also be provided with step-by-step instructions on how to find and troubleshoot an issue. They will try to login/open a webpage The page will error out/show an error message The attendee will then follow the instructions to fix the issue. (This may involve running some kubectl commands) Once the issue is fixed, the web page should load and allow the participant to sign up for the ring. 
The attendee will require some Kubernetes knowledge and a laptop that they can use to SSH into a LINUX VM running in GCP.
How to Register: The in-person event is sold out (waitlist available). To register for Advanced Kubernetes Troubleshooting Made Simple with Open Source Tools virtual or add yourself to the in-person waitlist, add it on during your KubeCon + CloudNativeCon registration.

Air Gap Lab: Delivering Kubernetes Applications to Air Gapped Environments hosted by Replicated – IN-PERSON SOLD OUT (Waitlist Available)
Date: Tuesday, October 12, 2021 | Times: 9:00 – 11:00 AM PDT | Location: Room 402AB + VirtualRegistration Fees: Complimentary

Air gapped environments are enjoying increased popularity with the Enterprise in cloud, on-prem, and hybrid environments. While more secure, losing the convenience of internet connectivity means that your applications are potentially inaccessible to your air gapped clients – or are they? 
Fortunately, there are innovative and timely open source tools available to streamline the process of getting your customers up and running as quickly as possible. These open source tools can do everything from launching your application to even deploying an embedded Kubernetes cluster specific to your needs. 
In this lab, you will receive a hands-on lesson on how to successfully build custom Kubernetes clusters, deploy and manage applications, and investigate and resolve issues in highly secured Kubernetes environments. 
What you will do: 
Access and verify a single-node air gap setup via a bastion server Learn how to use KOTS (Kubernetes-Off-The-Shelf) to install in an air gap environment Create an SSH tunnel to configure an air gap instance Perform an upgrade of an application in an air gap environment Use the kubectl support-bundle CLI in an air gap environment.
Who this is for:
This lab is for anyone who builds/maintains KOTS applications (see note below)Full Stack / DevOps / Product Engineers 
Pre-requisites: Basic working knowledge of Kubernetes 
Outcomes: 
You will be ready to deliver a KOTS application into an air gap environment You will build confidence in performing upgrades and troubleshooting in air gap environments 
Note — a more minimal air gap lab is in the works for non-dev teams to learn the user-side installation workflow without needing to understand the building/packaging of new air gap versions. Until that is made available, this lab is also appropriate for: 
Implementation / Field EngineersSupport Engineers
How to Register: The in-person event is sold out (waitlist available). To register for Air Gap Lab virtual or add yourself to the in-person waitlist, add it on during your KubeCon + CloudNativeCon registration.

Kubernetes environments are inherently dynamic with teams adding 15+ services to an average K8s cluster every week. Those new services either become 15+ apps that must be instrumented with language agents every week or the absence of instrumentation results in observability blindspots. 
Pixie is an open source observability platform for Kubernetes that automatically provides observability for every new service in seconds without instrumentation. By getting telemetry data at the kernel level, Pixie is a language-agnostic solution that helps developers debug faster through code-level insights and removes the observability gaps that naturally emerge in Kubernetes environments. 
Join us for a hands-on workshop where we will instrument a cloud-native application with Pixie and use out-of-the-box scripts to identify and root-cause bottlenecks and errors. In 2 hours, you will learn to: 
Install and Deploy Pixie Visualize Kubernetes clusters and application performance data Use Continuous Profiling to investigate Infrastructure anomalies Analyze Slow DB Queries Dynamic Logging (without log.withfield()) AND MORE!

How to Register: This event is sold out. To add yourself to the waitlist for Instantly Debug your Kubernetes Clusters Using Pixie, add it on during your KubeCon + CloudNativeCon registration.

Overcoming Data-Tier Challenges on Kubernetes and Cloud-Native Deployments hosted by DataStax
Date: Monday, October 11, 2021 | Time: 8:00 – 11:00AM PDT | Location: Online – VirtualRegistration Fees: Complimentary

Many teams building highly scalable, cloud-native applications, have struggled with finding a data solution that can keep pace with the needs of their application. Often this has meant a choice between using a managed database, or taking on the task of deploying and managing a database on Kubernetes. Apache Cassandra™ is a powerful database used in many applications that require resilience and scalability, but has traditionally been challenging to deploy and manage effectively. Now the Kubernetes and Cassandra communities have come together in a great collaboration called K8ssandra, a production-ready platform that makes it easy to run Cassandra™ on Kubernetes. In this workshop, you will learn the challenges of managing a data tier in Kubernetes and how to overcome them using K8ssandra. 
With a primarily hands-on approach, we will cover introductory and in-depth topics that include: 
Creating a K8ssandra release using Helm Monitoring database performance through metrics and alerts Breaking nodes in the database cluster on purpose to observe self-healing Scaling the database resources up and down Deploying applications on top of the database using CQL and REST APIs Backing up and restoring data Multi region deployment (time and resources permitting) 
Attendance at this workshop is free. If you’d like to attend any other sessions that KubeCon has to offer, you will need to register for the conference here!
