						About					





For years, Embedded Linux Conference (ELC) has been the premier, vendor-neutral technical conference for companies and developers using Linux in embedded products. In the last few years, the conference has expanded its scope to include both the user-space developers building applications on embedded Linux as well as the architects and developers working to deliver smart connected products and industrial IoT solutions.
Embedded Linux Conference (ELC) gathers technical experts paving the way for transformation in these key areas from across the globe for education, collaboration, and deep dive learning opportunities.

ELC brought together all of the critical participants in two deeply connected ecosystems – the embedded systems that run on devices and the frameworks that connect those devices. It is a small community of the brightest minds talking openly and sharing ideas. We found being there invaluable.NOAH HARLANFOUNDER, TWO BULLS
