KVM Forum is an annual event that presents a rare opportunity for developers and users to meet, discuss the state of Linux virtualization technology, and plan for the challenges ahead. This highly technical conference unites the developers who drive KVM development and the users who depend on KVM as part of their offerings, or to power their data centers and clouds.


Sessions include updates on the state of the KVM virtualization stack, planning for the future, and many opportunities for attendees to collaborate. Over the years since its inclusion in the mainline kernel, KVM has become a critical part of the FOSS cloud infrastructure. Come join us in continuing to improve the KVM ecosystem.
