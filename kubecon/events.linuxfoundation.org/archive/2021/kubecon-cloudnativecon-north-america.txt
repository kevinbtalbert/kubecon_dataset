SHOW MORE



 

Organizations focused on newer open source software (OSS) technologies and solutions are well-positioned to respond to app modernization pressures stemming from today’s economic and societal challenges. More than ever KubeCon + CloudNativeCon provides an important forum for exchanging relevant information and insights on Kubernetes and broader DevOps trends.’ – Charlotte Dunlap, Principal Analyst, GlobalData







Highlights from KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021











 La La Land. The City of Angels.
The City of Los Angeles holds many distinctions. L.A. is the entertainment capital of the world, a cultural mecca boasting more than 100 museums, and a paradise of idyllic weather. From tourist attractions like the Walk of Fame’s collection of stars (numbering more than 2,614 and counting) to career opportunities like those presented in the expanding tech industry, Los Angeles is the place to be.
