What is the role of a Committee Member?

The Hyperledger Global Forum Program Committee helps shape the content that makes Hyperledger Global Forum a successful event. The main purpose of the 2021 committee is to review the Call for Proposals (CFP) submitted by the community. The Call For Proposal period was from February 1, 2021, to March 19, 2021. 
Each committee member spends approximately 8 hours during a 2-week timeframe reviewing proposals. Talks were assigned with two top-level categories, business and technical, and subcategories based on the committee member’s application reviewed by staff. Committee members then reviewed their assigned submissions through an online portal and followed the scoring guidelines as outlined below.
The program committee may also be called up to help ensure a conference agenda outline with a balance between panels, workshops, talks, and networking breaks and support event participation for example, as networking coordinators, moderators and/or emcees.



Inclusive collaboration by design

If you ever attended a Hyperledger event or meeting, you have likely heard the phrase “All Are Welcome Here”. Our program committee is representative of our community at large and we encouraged all reviewers to ensure that the speakers are coming from diverse backgrounds in all possible terms:
GenderGeographyCompaniesRaceEtc
For each review, the committee member was reminded to provide feedback  on the talk by answering questions like “Do the authors come from diverse backgrounds?” “Is the topic unusual?” “Does the submission get everyone to think outside of their boxes?” “Is the language not English?” “Will the topic actively encourage increasing diversity and inclusion?”



What are the 2021 CFP Scoring Guidelines?

Scoring Guidelines are an important part of the Content selection process integrity: It is very important to protect the integrity of the review process, and avoid the impression of a biased review and all our reviewers must also adhere to our Code of Conduct. Review the full 2021 program committee scoring guidelines and best practices here.
