REGISTRATION CLOSED


PrestoCon Day supports the tech community by helping organizations focused on tackling the diversity and inclusion gap. Through partnerships, we are driving initiatives to help underrepresented groups flourish and succeed in the tech world.  The Presto Foundation is committed to helping fundraise on behalf of Black Girls Code & Women Who Code through our registration process. If you’d like to make a donation, you may do so during registration. 
Learn more about each charitable fund:


Black Girls CodeVision: To increase the number of women of color in the digital space by empowering girls of color ages 7 to 17 to become innovators in STEM fields, leaders in their communities, and builders of their own futures through exposure to computer science and technology. To provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.


Women Who CodeVision: We envision a world where women are proportionally represented as technical leaders, executives, founders, VCs, board members, and software engineers.
