Engineers at Datadog use Kubernetes on a daily basis to deploy their workloads to production. Datadog’s Kubernetes infrastructure includes dozens of clusters, hundreds of nodes per cluster, hundreds of thousands of pods, and it runs on several clouds.
Just as sailors once used the stars as a guide we too can use measurement of our successes and failures to chart a course. Understanding history will help us predict the speed and course of Kubernetes and beyond.
This roundtable will bring together engineers who work on building our own production infrastructure and those who are responsible for building Datadog’s observability features for Kubernetes.
They will discuss their takes on the cloud native ecosystem today, the Kubecon EU 2021 announcements, and sessions they are excited about and what they believe will be the key changes for Kubernetes in the next 12 months.For questions regarding this event, please reach out to katie@datadog.com.

GIFEE Day hosted by Equinix Metal (REGISTRATION NOW CLOSED)
Date: Tuesday, May 4Time: 15:00 – 20:30 (CEST)Location:  VirtualRegistration Fees: Complimentary
In 2016, Alex Polvi at CoreOS coined the term “GIFEE” (Google’s Infrastructure for Everyone Else) to describe the benefits unlocked by containers at scale: agility, secure, efficiency, and reliability. Five years in, the cloud native vision has thrived beyond the wildest of imaginations.  
So what’s next for GIFEE? In a word: hardware. While cloud native software and management practices have proliferated, “next level” innovation increasingly depends on having specialized hardware in the right place at the right time. At GIFEE Day, we’ll look at the future of cloud native from an infrastructure lens: from provisioning and securing to monitoring and optimizing.  
GIFEE Day is complimentary to all KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 attendees. We’ll have 8 great livestream sessions from diverse community members hosted by Equinix Metal.

Edge Computing will be 4x larger than cloud and will generate 75% of data worldwide by 2025. With hardware and software spread across hundreds or thousands of locations, the only feasible way to manage these distributed systems are the simple paradigms around observability, loosely coupled systems, declarative APIs, and robust automation, that have made cloud native technologies so successful in the cloud. Kubernetes is already becoming a key part of the edge ecosystem, driving integrations and operations.
Join Kubernetes on Edge at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon to get in on the ground floor and shape the future intersection of cloud native and edge computing.

Running a Cloud-Native Data Tier with K8ssandra hosted by DataStax (REGISTRATION NOW CLOSED)
Date: Tuesday, May 4Time: 16:00 – 19:00 (CEST)Location:  VirtualRegistration Fees: Complimentary
Many teams building highly scalable, cloud-native applications, have struggled with finding a data solution that can keep pace with the needs of their application. Often this has meant a choice between using a managed database, or taking on the task of deploying and managing a distributed database on Kubernetes. Apache Cassandra™ is a powerful database used in many applications that require resilience and scalability, but has traditionally been challenging to deploy and manage effectively on Kubernetes. Now the Kubernetes and Cassandra communities have come together in a great collaboration called K8ssandra, a production-ready platform that makes it easy to run Cassandra™ on Kubernetes. 
In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy and manage a data tier based on Apache Cassandra™ cluster in Kubernetes using K8ssandra. We’ll explore activities using hands-on exercises, that include:
Creating a K8ssandra release using HelmUsing a benchmarking tool (NoSQLBench) to generate read/write load on the databaseMonitoring database performance through metrics and alertsBreaking nodes in the database cluster on purpose to observe how Cassandra self-healsScaling the database up and downDeploying applications on top of the database using CQL and REST APIsBacking up and restoring data
Presented byAleks Volochnev, DataStaxJeff Carpenter, DataStax
How to Register: Registration is now CLOSED for Running a Cloud-Native Data Tier with K8ssandra!For questions regarding this event, please reach out to  jessica.benton@datastax.com.


ScaleX hosted by Cisco (REGISTRATION NOW CLOSED)
Date: Tuesday, May 4Time: 10:00 – 17:00 (CEST)Location:  VirtualRegistration Fees: USD $20 donated to the CNCF Diversity Scholarship Fund
Today, it’s all about apps and digital services – not just to keep the business running – but also to grow and compete even more aggressively. But modern cloud native development can be complicated with the lack of true pipeline integration across tools for application platforms, security, and networking for an app-first world.
And this is exactly what inspired us to create ScaleX.
Join us to hear a prestigious line-up of presenters who will be sharing their experiences and knowledge around building for scalability and reliability and what that means for the modern cloud native developer. This second edition of ScaleX, hosted by Cisco, will feature a full day of sessions, deep dives, panels, and use cases from people just like you…the people building, operating, and maintaining secure, reliable cloud native systems at scale.
Visit the event website for more information!
How to Register: Registration is now CLOSED for ScaleX!
