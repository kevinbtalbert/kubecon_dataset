Conversations


EmpowerUs
Wednesday, May 5 | 15:30 – 16:05 CEST
Attendees who identify as women, non-binary individuals, and allies, are invited to join this special program. You’ll hear inspiring stories from women in open source, and an opportunity for meaningful interaction.
Thank you to our sponsor!




Allyship Workshop
Thursday, May 6 | 14:20 – 15:05 CEST
From Allyship to Sponsorship: Solutions to Design a Diverse and Inclusive Community. This session will engage the audience in creating a more diverse and inclusive open-source community. Research undoubtedly shows that investing in diversity and inclusion helps you develop better technology and increases your bottom line. The challenge is how do we get there; and how do we, as individuals, develop the leadership skills required to be part of the solution. 
Join our session to define what Diversity and Inclusion mean for you, and learn the best practices to be part of the solution.
Thank you to our sponsor!





Peer Group Mentoring + Career Networking
Friday, May 7 | 15:15 – 16:15 CEST
The community collectively has an immense depth of knowledge and expertise which we can explore and learn from at this collaborative event. Whether you’re new, or not so new to open source and the cloud native community, we invite you to register to attend. You’ll have the chance to meet with experienced open source veterans across many CNCF projects. You will be paired with other people in a pod-like setting to explore technical, community, and career questions together.
