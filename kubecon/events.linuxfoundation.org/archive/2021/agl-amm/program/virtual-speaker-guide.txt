If you would like to make updates to your speaker profile on Sched.com (biography, headshot, titles), send updates directly to jcrowley@linuxfoundation.org, so they can be integrated with the virtual platform.




Platform & Specifications 

We are using the virtual event platform, AccelEvents, which will allow speakers to deliver content via pre-recorded talks and participate in live Q&A text chat with attendees. The platform will be web-based and easy for everyone to access. The platform works best with Chrome so please plan to use Chrome to attend the conference.




Pre-recording Information & Tools

All breakout speakers will need to pre-record their talk, which will be played through the event platform. As the session ends, the speaker will then join live for Q&A  with attendees for an additional 5-10 minutes. 
Some suggested tools to use for recording are Quicktime, Google Hangouts, Zoom, a screen recorder, or something similar. The recording should show your slides/screen as well as you presenting using a picture in picture style format. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Presentation slides and videos need to be received no later than Friday, March 5.Session presentations will be 30 minutes, with 5-10 minutes for live Q&A.  We are requesting that all speakers leave the last 5-10 minutes open for Q&A time to make this virtual experience more interactive. 
Videos need to be received no later than Friday, March 5.



Presentation Template

An optional PowerPoint template is available for your use but is not required. Slides will be due with the recording on Friday, March 5.



Uploading Instructions for Pre-recorded Sessions

We have multiple options for uploading your pre-recorded presentation:
Videos files must be .mp4. You can add your recording directly into the Google folder. Please email jcrowley@linuxfoundation.org once you have uploaded it to the folder, share your file with jcrowley@linuxfoundation.org or let us know if you need an alternate method.Or let us know if you have an alternate method (DropBox, file sharing service, etc)
Videos need to be received no later than Friday, March 5.



Live Q&A

As with physical events, live interaction is essential to the success of virtual events and we are requiring every presenter, to be available during their session for live Q&A within the platform. This will provide added value to the audience and create more of an ‘event’ versus a ‘webinar’ experience. Please ensure you are available for 5-10 minutes immediately after your session to answer any attendee questions within the event platform.
If you are concerned about your timezone and how that could impact the live Q&A portion of your session, we will do our best to reschedule your session slot to a time that is convenient for you. If you are not comfortable with the idea of a live Q&A, or cannot participate “live,” please contact us immediately. 




Speaker Training

We will be sending a speaker training video shortly. The video will walk speakers through the platform, and how to present for live Q&A.



Technical Tips for Virtual Presentations

Audio – as counterintuitive as it may sound, the single most important factor in a good video, is the audio quality. Eliminate ambient noise – close the doors and windows. You’d be surprised how much environmental noise gets picked up.Lighting – Do not put lights overhead and don’t put any lights or windows behind you as they will alter the light levels in your videos and create shadows.Background – don’t be afraid to show your natural environment – bookcases, plants, paintings – as long as they are not too distracting.Framing – place yourself slightly off-center to the left or right rather than directly in the middle of the frame.Camera Height – the lens should either be directly level or pointing ever so slightly downwards towards your face.Stand – we recommend you stand during your presentation to help project your voice and improve your posture. However, if you’re more comfortable sitting, then please do.Timer – Have a clock to keep track of the time you have remaining.

Lighting, Webcam and Microphone Best Practices

Best Practices for Lighting
For best results, use natural light and supplement with additional light as needed.Keep natural light in front of you to avoid shadows. A bright window behind you can make you appear as a dark silhouette. Interior rooms with no natural light source may require additional targeted lighting, such as a ring light, to brighten the speaker’s face.
Best Practices for Webcams
To ensure the speaker is looking directly at the audience, place the webcam at eye level.Avoid distracting backgrounds by checking the surroundings behind you to make sure there are no distracting colors or movement.Presenters should use chairs that are adjustable for height but do not swivel. Swiveling on camera creates a poor attendee experience and can be distracting.
Best Practices for Microphones
Use external microphones whenever available, as microphones built into computers and cameras often have lower quality. An external microphone allows the speaker to place it in the optimal location for sound.Place the microphone close to the speaker’s mouth, but not in the camera view.Test audio levels in advance.Manage noise by turning off fans, phones, or speakers and keep ambient noise to a minimum. Do not touch the microphone while unmuted.
Dress Code
There is no dress code for presentations, and we encourage you to be comfortable. That said, you must be aware that the Code of Conduct applies to this space, both in terms of what you show on camera and what you say. We ask that you be tasteful and considerate in choosing your clothing and surroundings. Keep in mind that we are a global community. Please refrain from wearing shirts with global brand logos that are not your own. Solid colors (not white) also work best instead of prints. 



Tips to Keep Your Virtual Audience Engaged

Learn the Content: Familiarity with the content allows a speaker to focus on presenting, rather than trying to remember the points to make. To minimize worry about forgetting elements of the presentation, include notes in your presentation file and have a printout of your script or talking points.Practice Makes Perfect: Speakers should practice their content delivery in the environment in which they will deliver it, such as in front of a computer. Presenting alone to a computer can be awkward at first. To make speakers more comfortable, ask colleagues, roommates, or family to sit in front so they can present to familiar faces.Understand the Tools: Speakers should understand and utilize the content options available to them, to maximize the effectiveness of the presentation technology. It’s important to know the basic functions of the software, e.g. how to advance slides, manage Q&A or chats, before the presentation. Speak Up: Check audio levels before presenting, but also make sure to breathe at regular intervals to speak audibly and clearly. Maintaining a clear, even tone throughout the presentation will allow the audience to hear it without adjusting their volume settings.Look at Your Camera: If presenting via video, remember, the webcam is your link to your audience. Make eye contact with the camera so it appears to the audience that you are speaking directly to them.Don’t Fear Mistakes: Humans make mistakes, even during presentations. Realize that flubs happen and they won’t derail your presentation – unless you let them. Just keep going in your planned presentation and remember, the audience is forgiving.Be Prepared: During the presentation, have a glass of water nearby to sip as needed. Also, keep handy a printout of your slides or notes in case you need to refer to them.

Inclusive Speaker Orientation Online Course

The Linux Foundation, in collaboration with the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT), has created an online course designed to teach the viewer about inclusion, diversity, and unconscious bias. We highly recommend all of our speakers watch the course to learn tips/tools to use when speaking to encourage inclusivity in presentations and messaging. 



Code of Conduct

Please read and abide by our code of conduct, which can be found here. We ask that speakers especially review this code of conduct and are inclusive in the words and images used during their presentation.
