Nebulon

Nebulon, Inc. was founded by a group of ex-3PAR executives to pioneer Cloud-Defined Storage, on-prem, server-based enterprise-class storage that consumes no server CPU or memory resources, and is defined and managed through the cloud. It’s powered by the Nebulon cloud – Nebulon ON – and a PCIe card called a services processing unit or ‘SPU’ that is part of your clustered application servers.
This revolutionary approach provides a cost-effective storage platform for mission critical applications with easily accessible AIOps, self-managed updates and powerful programmability at any scale.
