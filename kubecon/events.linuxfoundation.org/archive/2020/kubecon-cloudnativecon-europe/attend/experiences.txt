The New Stack “Pancake Breakfast“: Is Kubernetes Boring Yet? What’s on Your Stack?Monday, August 17 | 14:00 CEST


Kubernetes is boring and that’s a good thing. It’s what’s on top of Kubernetes that counts. So join us for a short stack with The New Stack as we ask: “What’s on your stack?” We’ll pass the virtual syrup, and talk about all that goes with Kubernetes. It may be stateless, but that also means there’s plenty of room for sides …

Songwriter Showcase + Meet & Greet with Michael Hicks + BandTuesday, August 18 | 19:15 – 20:15 CEST


Enjoy a private songwriter showcase performance by Michael Hicks followed by a live virtual meet + greet! Hicks is a unique blend of talent and humility which is rarely found in today’s emerging talent. As an artist, writer, and performer, Hicks is revered as one of the best in the diverse Funk and Soul music scene in Nashville and beyond. His Freshman album, This Is Life, highlights the talents of his writing ability, the moral message of his music, and the production talents of both himself and James Waddell. When he’s not writing and performing his own original music, Hicks is on the road touring the world with Blues icon, Keb’ Mo. International touring has lent him years of maturity that most young artists never get to experience. This interesting blend of influences and experiences have made him “the” artist to watch in Nashville.
