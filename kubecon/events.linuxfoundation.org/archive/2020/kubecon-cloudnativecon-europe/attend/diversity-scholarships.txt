						Diversity Scholarships					





Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s diversity scholarship program provides support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the technology and/or open source communities (including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities) who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend CNCF events for financial reasons.
Recipients will receive complimentary conference registration to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon as well as one CNCF organized Day Zero Co-located Event. Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection will be made by an assembled group of reviewers who will assess each applicant’s request. All application information will be kept confidential.
Scholarship Applications Closed
