Our first virtual KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe will bring innovators from all around the world together over four days in August. As we get ready for the big event, we want to see all the amazing places that our global community calls home. Thank you to all who participated in our #PhippyContest!
Congratulations to grand prize winner @joseadanof! His photo from Santiago, Chile has garnered the most likes and won him a free registration to the next in-person KubeCon + CloudNativeCon event! See all the photos from around the world at #PhippyContest.
