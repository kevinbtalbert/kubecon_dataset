				Open Networking & Edge Summit Europe			






Hosted By





We sincerely regret to inform you that in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and out of an abundance of caution for our community, we have made the decision to cancel Open Networking & Edge Summit Europe this year.  We had truly hoped that we could continue to hold this event, but at this point, we believe that it is in our community’s best interest to not move forward in order to keep everyone safe and healthy.  
We encourage you to participate in the Open Networking & Edge North America Summit Virtual Experience taking place on September 28-30 in the US Eastern Standard Time Zone. 
If you have any questions, please contact us at events@linuxfoundation.org.
