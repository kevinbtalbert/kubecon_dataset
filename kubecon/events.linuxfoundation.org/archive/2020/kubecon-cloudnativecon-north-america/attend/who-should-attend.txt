The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s flagship conference gathers leading technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities to further the education and advancement of cloud native computing.
Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies enable higher velocity software development at a lower cost than traditional infrastructure. Cloud native – orchestrating containers as part of a microservices architecture – is a departure from traditional application design. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is helping to build a map through this new terrain, and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is where the community comes together to share their expertise on this formerly uncharted but increasingly popular territory.
