What is the time zone for the event?
Live content will begin daily at 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) with presentations over four consecutive days. The schedule will automatically be displayed in EST. To see the schedule in your preferred time zone (once the schedule is live), please select the time zone from the drop-down menu to the right, above “Filter by Date.”
What are the system requirements needed to participate in the virtual event?
We are using the Intrado virtual event platform for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 – Virtual, and this is a web-based, HTML5 platform. You do not need to download any application to participate, and browsers on almost all devices will work.  View system/browser requirements here. Attendee pre-event emails will include a quick System Check so you can test your access before the event starts. Live technical assistance will be available within the event platform during the event to help you troubleshoot any issues.
Will the content be different in a virtual experience setting?
Slightly. We are adjusting our typical in-person event schedule to better fit with an online event world. We’ll still be bringing you plenty of sessions and content just a tad scaled down so the days aren’t too long (hello screen fatigue!). While some of our onsite experiences aside from content can’t be replicated online, we’re working to put together alternate experiences that can, which will help provide attendees a fully immersive event experience. Stay tuned for more details!
How will the virtual sessions work?
Sessions will take place at scheduled times just as they would at a face-to-face event. Speakers will be available for live Q+A with conference sessions and tutorials. Attendees can build a personalized agenda of sessions they want to view and receive notifications before they start. And of course, all sessions will be recorded and available to attendees on-demand after the event.
Will the event include closed captioning?
Yes! Closed captioning will be available for each session when it “goes live.” Learn more.
Will all sessions be recorded?
Yes! Once the event ends, all attendees will be able to access the sessions and other content and resources from the event platform. Additionally, all recorded sessions will be uploaded to the  CNCF YouTube channel within eight weeks of the event so they are accessible to anyone, anywhere.
When will the platform open?
Registered attendees will gain access to the platform on Monday, November 16 at 10:00 AM EST.
I attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America mainly for networking. How is that possible in a virtual event?
We know how invaluable face-to-face networking is at events. Attendees will be able to connect with speakers, sponsors, and experts through a Slack workspace with varied topic channels in both group and 1:1 chats with other event participants.
How will the Code of Conduct be enforced in a virtual environment?
All participants must abide by the CNCF Code of Conduct in a virtual environment just as they would at a physical one. We will be monitoring language and images throughout the platform to ensure there are no violations of the CoC, and quickly handle any that we might find. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately via the Slack help desk: 
Vanessa Heric, Associate Director of CNCF Events (+1 949-415-4442; vheric@linuxfoundation.org)Colleen Mickey, Director of Events (+1 516-945-9285; cmickey@linuxfoundation.org)Angela Brown, General Manager of Events (+1 575-694-2263; angela@linuxfoundation.org)
