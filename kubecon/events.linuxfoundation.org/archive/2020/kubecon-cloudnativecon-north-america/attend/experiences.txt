Escape Room Experience



Don’t miss out on this immersive experience designed to stimulate your senses, emotions, and place you in environments that are believable and above all FUN! Participants will be randomly placed in teams and in a themed escape room. Can you make it out in under 60 minutes? Only time will tell…







Trivia

We may not be able to meet at the local pub, but we can still crack a cold one and play online! Enjoy two nights with two trivia games each – all with a different theme and two meant to engage the kids at home if you’re so inclined. All players will be automatically placed in teams and prizes will be awarded for winners!
Space is limited – don’t miss your chance to participate and RSVP now!
Note: Due to space constrictions, families will count as one player.
