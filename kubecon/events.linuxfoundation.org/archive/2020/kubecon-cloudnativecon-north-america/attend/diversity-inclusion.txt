Conversations



EmpowerUs Event: Uniting to Drive Tech Sector Growth through Diversity + InclusionTuesday, November 17 | 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM ET
Concerted efforts to build diversity and inclusion into the tech sector are essential. Different experiences, outlooks and perspectives make your entire workforce better at solving complex problems, managing risks and spotting opportunities. This kind of strength and resilience is needed more urgently than ever as rapidly industry growth creates critical talent gaps and shortages. Meeting this demand by increasing employee diversity and the number of women pursuing tech sector careers, investing in the education they need to prepare and succeed, and ensuring visibility and career advancement for those currently working in the industry is imperative.
Host Ali Fenn, president of ITRenew, will be joined by members of the iMasons organization, including Chairman and Founder Dean Nelson and Amber Caramella of IM Women, for a candid discussion on what it will take for tech companies to foster this approach to growth and culture of paying it forward. Ali will also share her experiences working toward a more diverse and sustainable digital future. The panel will be followed by an interactive session where you’ll have a chance to comment, debate and discuss with panelists and peers.
RSVP today! An official RSVP for the EmpowerUs conversation is required.
