Overview

We are excited to welcome you as a keynote speaker for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020, which will take place virtually, Tuesday, November 17‚ÄìFriday, November 20, with content starting each day at 1:00PM Eastern Standard Time (UTC‚Äì05:00).¬†
This is your official event keynote speaker guide, which contains pertinent information regarding deadlines and speaker responsibilities. Please bookmark this page for easy reference and continue to check back as the event gets closer as we will be adding additional keynote speaker information, such as on-site details, as they are available. If you have any questions, please email Nanci Lancaster.
Please click through the tabs on this page to access information.



Registration
To confirm that you will be presenting, please go to the speaker-specific registration page to register as a speaker by Friday, October 9. If you previously purchased your registration, please email Nanci Lancaster and she will get your registration updated and any refunds processed.
Note: Our registration system is now integrated with the Linux Foundation Single sign-on (SSO) platform. After clicking ‚ÄúRegister Now‚Äù, you will be prompted to log in with your existing SSO account or to create a new one. If you have forgotten the password for an existing account, reset it by clicking ‚ÄúForgot Password.‚Äù
You will also be able to use 3rd party authentication providers (Gmail, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook) to automatically generate your SSO Account. If you experience issues, click the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù link on the SSO page to connect with our support team.





Platform Details
The platform we‚Äôve chosen to use is Intrado, which allows speakers to deliver content via live and pre-recorded talks and join live for Q&A with attendees via text, audio, or video chat. The platform is an HTML5 web-based platform, and will be easy for everyone to access and use. 
The Intrado platform is allowing us to create an immersive experience for attendees, with educational sessions that offer speaker and attendee Q&A and interaction, attendee collaboration & networking through topical chat rooms, and 1:1 and group chats, gamification to keep attendees engaged throughout the event, and a sponsor and tech showcase that offers 3D booths where attendees can view demos, download resources, check out job openings, and speak directly with booth reps.
We know you have a lot of questions about the platform, and we have put together an FAQ page, which will be updated continuously as we work through all aspects of the virtual event. If you have a question that is not included, please contact us to let us know.¬†
Live Q&A
As with physical events, live interaction is essential to the success of virtual events and we ask every keynote presenter to be available during their session for live Q&A for at least 15-minutes after the last keynote presenter ends their talk for your keynote block. The Q&A between attendees and keynote speakers will take place on Slack.
This will provide added value to the audience and create more of an ‚Äòevent‚Äô versus a ‚Äòwebinar‚Äô experience.






Speaker PowerPoint Presentation Template
We designed an optional KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America Virtual PowerPoint template for our speakers. Use of this template is not required but we do welcome you to use it for your convenience.
Email final presentation slides to Nanci Lancaster by Friday, November 20 so she can add to sched.com after the event concludes.

Co-Chair Meeting
Meet with Co-Chairs by Friday, October 23
We strictly enforce a no-pitch, non-advertorial policy for all of our presentations, especially on the keynote stage. Leading up to the event, either Stephen Augustus or Constance Caramanolis, the co-chairs for North America, will contact you to review your presentation and ensure the messaging resonates with our audience. The deadline to meet with one of the co-chairs is Friday, October 23, and you must have a draft of your presentation at the time of the meeting.

Helpful Notes on Presentation Design
Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of over 1000 cloud native projects, products, and companies are available in the cloud native landscape and the serverless and member landscapes. All logos are in the card mode and can be found with Cmd-F or Cntl-F from your browser. Note that all of these logos are stacked, not horizontal, and include the name. The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they‚Äôre not). Also note that the text below the logo shows the proper capitalization of projects like gRPC and containerd. In particular, Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have all changed their logos in the last couple years; please use their current one.Please see the CNCF style guide which covers things like abbreviating Kubernetes as K8s not K8 or K8S.
