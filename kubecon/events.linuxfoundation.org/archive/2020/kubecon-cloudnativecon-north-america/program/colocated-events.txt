As an official KubeCon 2020 challenge, attendees are invited to join the Trend Micro and Snyk Capture the Flag – Security Challenge!
You have always wanted to join a Capture the Flag security challenge but have never taken the chance. You have been studying and training in isolation, mainly in the remote corners of your unintended home office waiting for the opportunity — and now that time has arrived!
Whether you are a novice application coder or experienced security practitioner, this challenge is designed to bring out the fun and competitiveness expected in a Capture the Flag competition with one catch…it will take less than an hour. 
Join Trend Micro and Snyk security experts and our world class commentators for a hands-on learning experience as you navigate a simulated cyberattack against applications, and protect them using Trend Micro and Snyk security tools. 
Join this action-packed session to protect cloud native applications and learn to:• Deploy and integrate security early on in your Jenkins pipeline• Detect and investigate open source vulnerabilities, and threats in container images• Simulate an attack on a running container in EKS based on the results identified• Protect the application with security-as-code to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited
Top 3 winners will be given to the competitors with the most points + bragging rights.  This experience has something for everyone! Compete alongside your peers, listen to guest commentators as you climb the leader board, and sit in the same chair you have not left for the past 9 months as you strive to win each level of the challenge and bragging rights for the top prizes.

This event allows and encourages open collaboration and sharing of cloud native security accomplishments and roadblocks.  Cloud native security is a multi-objective and multi-constrained problem space spanning many areas. Pretty much everything falls into security, from identity management to storage solutions. Cloud Native Security Day (#cnsecurityday) is intended to drive collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing of cloud native security accomplishments and roadblocks. Get connected with others that are passionate about security. Learn from practitioners about pitfalls to avoid, hurdles to jump, and how to integrate security into your cloud native project, architecture, and enhance team awareness on security.

Production Identity Day: SPIFFE + SPIRE hosted by CNCF
Date: Tuesday, November 17 | Time: 11:00 AM  – 6:00 PM ET | Location: VirtualRegistration Fees: US$20

“Production identity” is a common set of identity and authentication challenges facing distributed systems.  Many spend significant time and effort in establishing trusted bi-directional communication between different parts of the system.  Often these are lacking in many respects: not rooted in sound identity “bedrock”, no ability to rotate credentials, no federation with other systems, and few policy opportunities (which are highly valued and critical for enterprises). 
SPIFFE and SPIRE are CNCF incubating projects that aim to solve these challenges in a common way by defining and implementing a universal identity control plane that can be leveraged across many different types of systems — not just containerized or cloud native.
We are excited to host the first Production Identity Day at KubeCon to share learnings around the latest developments in the space, exhibit demonstrations, and discuss real-world use cases with others who share an interest in identity, authentication, and zero trust security.

Putting Apache Cassandra™ on Automatic with Kubernetes hosted by DataStax
Date: Tuesday, November 17 | Time: 12:00  – 3:00 PM ET | Location: VirtualRegistration Fees: Complimentary

Deploying a scalable, elastic and self-healing data plane in Kubernetes should be easy. In this workshop we’ll show you how to do it with ready to go tooling that gives you everything you need to be successful. Apache Cassandra™ combined with Kubernetes compliment each other so well, you’ll wonder why you haven’t tried it before.
Don’t compromise on your choice. You can use the same database that has been making a difference at companies like Home Depot, Netflix and Apple without having to become an expert at distributed systems. Data use cases from financial services transactions to entertainment streaming services all rely on Cassandra and impact our daily lives.
In this workshop, we will introduce you to how Cassandra’s architecture and logical fault domains are complimented by Kubernetes. You’ll take a typical containerized application and deploy it with a fully automated data service backed by Apache Cassandra. Move fast with confidence and very few trade-offs. Don’t miss it!
All attendees will receive a FREE Cassandra certification voucher ($145 value).

ScaleX hosted by Cisco
Date: Tuesday, November 17 | Time: 10:00 AM  – 5:00 PM ET | Location: VirtualRegistration Fees: US$20 (donated to the CNCF Diversity Scholarship Fund)

Why join us for ScaleX?
Today, it’s all about apps and digital services – not just to keep the business running – but to also grow and compete even more aggressively. But modern cloud native development can be complicated with the lack of true pipeline integration across tools for application platforms, security, and networking for an app-first world.
This is exactly what inspired us to create ScaleX. We have a full day of sessions that explore what building for scalability and reliability means for the modern cloud native developer. At ScaleX, you’ll hear from the people building, operating, and maintaining reliable cloud native systems at scale in a full day of tutorials, deep dives, and use cases.
It’s time to put scalability and reliability first when building, operating, and maintaining truly cloud native systems. So, be sure to join us at ScaleX!
