Platform Details
The platform we’ve chosen to use is Intrado, which allows speakers to deliver content via pre-recorded talks and join live for Q&A with attendees via text, audio, or video chat. The platform is an HTML5 web-based platform, and will be easy for everyone to access and use. All talks will be available on Intrado for viewing and we will also be moving them to YouTube so anyone, anywhere, can view them as well.
The Intrado platform is allowing us to create an immersive experience for attendees, with educational sessions that offer speaker and attendee Q&A and interaction, attendee collaboration & networking through topical chat rooms, and 1:1 and group chats, gamification to keep attendees engaged throughout the event, and a sponsor and tech showcase that offers 3D booths where attendees can view demos, download resources, check out job openings, and speak directly with booth reps.
Important Note: If you are recording within the platform, unfortunately, the platform only supports PowerPoint files for presentation slides. We’ve created a branded, optional, PowerPoint Presentation Template for you to use.
We understand limiting to PowerPoint as a presentation format is not ideal and apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. If you have any issues with converting your presentation to PowerPoint, please let us know as we are happy to convert your file for you. We do request that if we are converting your slides, you limit it to basic fonts to make it easier for us. If you wish to convert your presentation on your own from PDF, we recommend following Adobe’s instructions on how to convert to PowerPoint. If you are using Google Slides, Keynote, or any other presentation software, we recommend using their built-in export-to-PowerPoint converter and reviewing for any custom text errors before sending your presentation to us. Note: If you are self-recording, this presentation slide format limitation of PowerPoint only does not apply to you.
We know you have a lot of questions about the platform, and we have put together an FAQ page, which will be updated continuously as we work through all aspects of the virtual event. If you have a question that is not included, please contact us to let us know. 




Session Logistics
Having a good internet connection is critical for attendee engagement at the end of your presentation. Please make sure your internet is fast and not being used by anyone else in your household. If you are able to, please connect your computer directly to your router vs using wi-fi. 
Watch this Speaker Training Video to get familiar with the platform.
You will need to arrive to your session 30-minutes prior to the start time to ensure your audio, video, and internet are ready for live Q&A. Note: If you are on a session with more than two speakers, you will arrive at least 60-minutes prior to the start time.
You will receive a calendar invite by Sunday, November 15, from speakersinvites@cvent.com with instructions on how to log in for live Q&A.
This calendar invite contains pertinent information you will need to participate live with attendees.
After your session concludes, we ask that you continue the conversation and answer any remaining questions on your session’s designated track’s Slack channel for at least 15-minutes. Please notify Nanci Lancaster immediately if you will not be able to participate in live Q&A.
Note: If your session is over 35-minutes in duration, you will be informed that you can engage in Q&A via the text chat function in the platform but there will be no time for any audio/video Q&A.





Day of Session Instructions
Test Your Computer for Platform Compatibility: Run a system check to ensure your computer is configured properly for the platform.Please also run a compatibility check, which tests your webcam and audio devices, along with WebRTC and WebSocket connectivity on your network for streaming media (which includes webcam/microphone, screen share,  media files, VCU, Encoder, etc.).If you encounter any issues, please refer to Intrado’s additional computer tips which provide additional information to help optimize your system set-up. 30-minutes prior to your session beginning (or 60-minutes if a panel), please dial into the Conference Phone Bridge: (866) 668-0721If you are outside of the United States, please use the Global Dial-in Number link within your calendar invite to retrieve the phone number associated with your area.Input the code listed in the calendar invite to access your specific conference line.What is the phone bridge? The conference bridge is a communication link to you and the engineer, in case something goes wrong within the platform or your internet. If you are on your cell, you can communicate directly with your engineer. The phone bridge is not what will be used for your main audio to attendees, it is a “lifeline” to your A/V engineer. Next, click on your specific speaker backend access link located in your calendar invite.After you are all logged in via phone and the backend link, the engineer will talk to you through the phone until everything is set up correctly, after your internet, audio, and webcam have been tested. Note: If your pre-recording is over the 35-minute limit in duration, you will be informed that you can only participate in Q&A via the text chat box.Live Speakers (Presenting Live): Once everything has been tested, the engineer will do a countdown shortly before the start time to count you in (5, 4, 3,…,…) and you will begin your presentation. You will go on mute on your phone and once your session begins, your audio will feed via your computer either through your microphone setup, to begin the presentation.Simulive Speakers (Pre-Recorded): You will go on mute on your phone and once the presentation recording has ended, your audio will feed via your computer through your microphone setup, to answer any questions.All speakers are required to participate in Live Q&A with attendees. You are encouraged to answer questions in the Q&A textbox while your presentation is playing. At the end of your presentation, you will be brought on video and audio to answer any remaining questions.If you wish to not be on video, that is fine, but please let the engineer know ahead of time what your preference is.Note: If your session is over 35-minutes in duration, you will be informed that you can engage in Q&A via the text chat function in the platform but there will be no time for any audio/video Q&A.Continuing on Slack: After the session has completely ended, please navigate to your track’s slack channel to continue answering any remaining questions and keep the conversations going for at least 15 more minutes.

Session Moderators
All sessions will have a monitor that is either a Linux Foundation staff member, a track chair, or a CNCF Ambassador. Their role is simply to relay back any technical issues to Nanci Lancaster, as well as monitor the Q&A chat box for Code of Conduct violations. They will not be introducing you to the attendees.
