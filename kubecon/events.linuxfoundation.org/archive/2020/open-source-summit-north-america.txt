WHAT ATTENDEES ARE SAYING




A fabulous morning of keynotes at #OSSummit – so much to think about, relevant for the period we are living in and the role we can play as #opensource technologists –  to be kinder, more inclusive and more aware.   Thank you @linuxfoundation— Nithya Ruff (@nithyaruff) June 30, 2020




This was just awesome, awesome, awesomex100Thanks @linuxfoundation for the opportunity to participate via the complementary pass to the #OSSummit #lfelc. I'm watching the recorded sessions, this was the best online event I attended entire lockdown😁🥳😎🙏👍— pr0PM (@MP0rp) July 3, 2020






Thank you @linuxfoundation for the Zen Zone at the virtual #OpenSource Summit. The penguin cams, and the puppy cams are so cute!! Also love the desk yoga option and stretch class. <3 #OSSummit #LFELC pic.twitter.com/NvCg98zhQe— Shilla Saebi 🥑 😷 (@ShillaSaebi) June 30, 2020





this is a supercool way of keeping it interesting #lfoss #OSSummit pic.twitter.com/4ey2Auifgj— Stefano Maffulli (@smaffulli) June 30, 2020






The RISC-V keynote is totally worth watching (if you're not at the event, it'll be on YouTube later!), gives probably the best introduction to ISAs I've ever seen, which is saying a lot because I spent way too much time trying to understand the concept #OSSummit pic.twitter.com/ZgDzCTNBaO— Elizabeth K. Joseph (@pleia2) July 1, 2020




My second talk at #OSSummit starts in 5 minutes! 👩‍💻👩‍🏫 All the Databases! Pretty proud to share the knowledge of different databases I have learned over the years! #apachecassandra #PostgreSQL #graphdatabases #mysql pic.twitter.com/V3ldObWHHx— Amanda ✨ (@AmandaK_Data) July 1, 2020




I have been so lucky to land on an open source team that has done so many of these things, and it has meant so much. The talks on leadership and diversity and inclusion at the #OSSummit have been phenomenal, and I hope help experiences like mine become the norm. https://t.co/20ViX5ReOL— Monica Ayhens-Madon (@peripateticacad) June 30, 2020






FEATURED SPEAKERS

Linus Torvalds
Creator of Linux & Git





Linus was born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1988, graduating with a master’s degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled “Linux: A Portable Operating System” and was the genesis for what would become the most important collaborative software project in history. In August 1991, Linus announced that he was developing the Linux kernel, proclaiming, “it won’t be big and professional.” Never in the history of technology has someone been so wrong. In spite of his humble proclamation, Linux has become the world’s most pervasive operating system. Today the Linux kernel forms the basis of the Linux operating system and powers billions of Android devices, powers ChromeOS, and has permeated almost every industry and form factor. Smartphones, TVs, appliances, cars, nuclear submarines, air traffic control, stock exchanges, and scientific research all run Linux. Linux also provides the underpinnings of the internet and the cloud computing industry. In 2005, citing a lack of free and open-source version control tools that met his needs for performance and scale, Linus famously created Git in only 10 days. Today Git is widely used in software development and for other version-control tasks such as configuration management and has become popular as an integral part of the DevOps culture. In 2000, Linus was listed by Time Magazine as Number 17 in the Time 100: Most Important People of the Century. Again, in 2004, Time Magazine named him one of the Most Influential People in the world. He was honored in 2008 with the Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland, “in recognition of his creation of a new open-source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel.” He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award. A true tech titan, he was admitted to the Computer History Museum Hall of Fellows, joining the ranks of the tech elite including Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, Tim Berners-Lee, Gordon Moore, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Steve Wozniak, and others. Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.

A major recurring theme in her work is composability. She seeks to enable the construction of complex distributed systems via the composition of well-understood components that are correct by construction.


Some of Heather’s projects include programming models and type systems to facilitate the design of new, functional distributed systems, such as distributable closures, flexible, extensible, and performant serialization, asynchronous and concurrent programming via futures and promises, and deterministic concurrent dataflow.


She works on and around the Scala programming language
