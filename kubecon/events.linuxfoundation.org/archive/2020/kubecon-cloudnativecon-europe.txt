Some great stats shared by @pritianka about CNCF â€“ "50+ projects, 97000 contributors. 177 countries, 1.3 million lines of code, 550+ members, 144 end users". Great keynote!! #KubeCon #CloudNativeCon #CNCFâ€” Kaushik Chaubal (@kaushikchaubal) August 18, 2020






Another appreciable thing about #KubeCon EU virtual â€“ diversity, esp gender diversity. One of many examples: this security and HPC panel right now. 4/5 are female-identified or nonbinary. pic.twitter.com/aNAz2O7YqEâ€” Beth Pariseau (@PariseauTT) August 20, 2020

#KubeCon2020 just ended! Kudos to the organisers and everyone that was part of this year's @CloudNativeFdn virtual KubeCon. A great event indeed!â€” Uchechukwu Obasi (@Thisisobate) August 20, 2020




Great to see @oicheryl promoting the "real world" view of cloud native and also the new @CloudNativeFdn end-user tech radar in the #KubeCon keynote"End-users have a lot of learning to share â€” they don't only have to be passive consumers" pic.twitter.com/Rk8TMKWj7Qâ€” Daniel Bryant (@danielbryantuk) August 18, 2020
