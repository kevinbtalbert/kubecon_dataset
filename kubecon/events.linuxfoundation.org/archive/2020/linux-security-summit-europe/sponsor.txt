The Linux Security Summit (LSS) is a technical forum for collaboration between Linux developers, researchers, and end users with the primary aim of fostering community efforts to analyze and solve Linux security challenges.
LSS is where key Linux security community members and maintainers gather to present their work and discuss research with peers, joined by those who wish to keep up with the latest in Linux security development and who would like to provide input to the development process.


Demonstrate your support for the future of security by sponsoring the Linux Security Summit.
