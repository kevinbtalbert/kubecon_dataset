September 9 – 10, 2020Virtual Experience#ASC2020

ASC 2020 is a wrap! Thank you to all of the attendees, speakers, and sponsors that joined us virtually this year. To experience the best of the event, be sure to watch the keynotes and breakout sessions on the OpenAPI Initiative YouTube channel, available by September 18. You can also review session slides from speakers who provided them via the event schedule.

OpenAPI Initiative’s API Specifications Conference (ASC) is a place for API practitioners to come together and discuss the evolution of API technology. ASC includes cutting edge technology keynotes and sessions that chart the future of APIs with in-depth specification and standards discussions. The event is designed to be highly interactive with plenty of discussion time throughout the sessions.
OpenAPI Specifications, RAML, Blueprint, gRPC, OData, JSON Schema, GraphQL, AsyncAPI and other formats will all be topics at the event, enabling attendees to get familiar with these formats and discuss how to use them in practice.

EVENT RECAP




#ASC2020 day two keynotes where so good I need to re-read the chat that flowed by. One comment in praise of API enforcement brought out my notepad: "better to build a community of passionate participants rather than a populace in a police state"Need to noodle on that— 𝕞𝕒𝕥𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕨 𝕣𝕖𝕚𝕟𝕓𝕠𝕝𝕕 (@libel_vox) September 10, 2020




Really enjoyed #ASC2020. It's been a while since I've attended one (or the old API Strat) and that was a mistake. Lots of learning and great conversations. Also, thank you for letting me present this year! It was an honor.— Jay Dreyer (@kaline) September 10, 2020




you know a panel is good when the chat is like, we want more of this! every week! 😂 #ASC2020— Taylor Barnett (@taylor_atx) September 10, 2020





Doing it all again today but with fewer nerves because my talk (90 mins from now) is about my real passions: APIs, SDKs and Developer Experience! You can also catch me on the panel later, because apparently there is no such thing as too much @lornajane ??!? #ASC2020 https://t.co/WwAZFa75Up— Lorna Mitchell (@lornajane) September 10, 2020
