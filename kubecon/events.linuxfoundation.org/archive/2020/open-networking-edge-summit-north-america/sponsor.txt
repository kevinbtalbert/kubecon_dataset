Open Networking & Edge Summit (formerly Open Networking Summit) is the industry’s premier open networking event now expanded to comprehensively cover Edge Computing, Edge Cloud & IOT. Open Networking & Edge Summit (ONES) enables collaborative development and innovation across enterprises, service providers/telcos and cloud providers to shape the future of networking and edge computing.




From my perspective, the Linux Foundation is doing a phenomenal job in fostering collaboration, and is creating tangible value and harmonizing the entire open source networking process.Will TownsendMOOR INSIGHTS & STRATEGY
