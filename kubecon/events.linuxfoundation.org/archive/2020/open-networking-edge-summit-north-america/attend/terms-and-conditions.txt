CODE OF CONDUCTThe Linux Foundation is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events, whether they are held in person or virtually. Linux Foundation events are working conferences intended for professional networking and collaboration in the Linux community. They exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at Linux Foundation events, in-person or virtual, or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff, and anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form.
The expanded Code of Conduct contains full details and examples, which cover behavior expectations, unacceptable behavior, and consequences, as well as incident reporting and response protocol.
PHOTO & VIDEO RELEASEI hereby consent to the photographing of myself and the recording of my voice and the use of these photographs and/or recordings singularly or in conjunction with other photographs and/or recordings for advertising, publicity, commercial or other business purposes for The Linux Foundation. I understand that the term “photograph” as used herein encompasses both still photographs and motion picture footage.
GDPR / DATA PROTECTION & ATTENDEE COMMUNICATION By submitting this registration form, you understand that the data you include will be submitted to The Linux Foundation and that The Linux Foundation may contact you regarding this event. Personal data collected from this registration form is subject to The Linux Foundation’s Privacy Policy. 
If applicable, by signing up to attend a Co-Located Event hosted by a third party, you understand that a portion of the data you submit will be provided to the third party, to enable the third party to hold the event. The third parties’ use of the data will be subject to their own privacy policies. 
In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event, you may choose to visit a third party’s virtual booth. You are never required to visit these third party booths. When visiting a booth (clicking on a third party’s logo on a booth icon in the exhibit hall, and any actions within the booth thereafter including viewing resources) the third party will receive some of your registration data. This data includes your First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Address, Email, Standard Demographics Questions (I.e. Company Size, Job Function, Industry), and details about the resources you interacted within their booth. If you choose to interact with a virtual booth, you are explicitly consenting to receipt and use of such data by the third-party recipients, which will be subject to their own privacy policies.
LIVE STREAMING AND REBROADCASTING OF LF EVENTS IS PROHIBITED You agree that you will not record, copy, reproduce, live stream, rebroadcast or otherwise distribute recordings, live streams, or broadcasts of events hosted by the Linux Foundation without first obtaining the express written permission of the Linux Foundation.
