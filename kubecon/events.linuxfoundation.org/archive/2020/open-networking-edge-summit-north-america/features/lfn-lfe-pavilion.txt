Edge computing represents a new paradigm in which compute and storage are located at the edge of the network, where actions are taken in the physical world. LF Edge establishes an open, interoperable framework for edge computing independent of hardware, silicon, cloud, or operating system. The LF Edge ecosystem, which is comprised of industry giants and start ups from all over the globe, collaborates to create hardware and software standards and best practices critical to sustaining current and future generations of IoT and edge devices in multiple industries. Project within LF Edge include Akraino, Baetyl, EdgeX Foundry, EVE, Fledge, Home Edge, Open Horizon, Secure Device Onboard and State of the Edge.
