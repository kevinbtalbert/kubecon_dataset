Overview
We are excited to welcome you as a speaker for Open Networking & Edge Summit 2020 which will take place virtually, Monday, September 28 –Wednesday, September 30, beginning each day at 10:30am Eastern Standard Time (EST).
The information provided below is intended to provide further details and answer questions about the virtual event platform, INXPO by Intrado. If you have general questions about the event, or virtual presentation tips, please refer to the Speaker Guide or the Web Presenting: Gear Tips + Enhancing Your Remote Studio document that was recently just created for one of our virtual events. If you have a question about the platform that is not included below, please contact us to let us know. 
Please note: The bulk of the information is geared towards non-Keynote speakers. If you are a Keynote speaker, the information may still be helpful but please note a few items like pre-recording and live Q&A are not relevant to you.



Platform & Specifications

What platform is being used?
We are using a virtual event platform called INXPO by Intrado that will allow speakers to deliver content by live stream or pre-record talks and join live for Q&A text chat with attendees. The platform is web-based with HTML5 and will be easy for everyone to access and use.

What does the platform offer? 
The INXPO by Intrado platform is allowing us to create an immersive experience for attendees, with educational sessions that offer speaker and attendee Q&A and interaction, attendee collaboration & networking through topical chat rooms, and 1:1 and group chats, gamification to keep attendees engaged throughout the event, and a sponsor and tech showcase that offers 3D booths where attendees can view demos, download resources, check out job openings, and speak directly with booth reps.

How do I make sure I can access the platform?

Run a system check to ensure your computer is configured properly for the platform.Run a compatibility check, which tests your webcam and audio devices, along with WebRTC and WebSocket connectivity on your network for streaming media (which includes webcam/microphone, screen share,  media files, VCU, Encoder, etc.). For any issues, refer to INXPO’s computer tips which provide additional information to help optimize your system set-up. 


How long will talks be available on the platform? 
All talks will be available on INXPO for viewing until KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 (November 17, 2020), and we will also be moving them to YouTube so anyone, anywhere, can view them as well.

Session Delivery & General Information

What options do I have to deliver my talk?
All keynote and breakout sessions will be required to pre-record their talk, either within the INXPO by Intrado platform or self-record.Tutorial sessions will have the option to do their talk live via zoom due to the in-depth interactive nature of these sessions. If they choose not to do it live, they must record within the platform.If you are a keynote presenter, we will follow up with you directly on your options. 

Is live Q&A required either way?
Breakout and tutorial speakers are requested to participate in live Q&A with attendees. Keynotes have the option to participate in Q&A via Slack.Panels and Tutorial sessions will be required to be present during their session, whether that is to fully present live or just for live Q&A at the end of the session (if pre-recorded). 

I want to interact more with attendees than a pre-recorded session allows. Is it possible to deliver my talk in another way?
If you want a more interactive session, please contact us so we can talk about what you are looking for and possible solutions.

My presentation doesn’t really make sense virtually. Can I request a change to my talk to tailor it more to an online presentation?
To update your session and tailor it for the virtual event, please contact us.  Change requests must be made no later than Friday, September 4.

I want to provide my own recording. Is this possible?
If you would like to record your session on your own, we can accept MP4 files, H.264 codec that are less than 4GB in size, with bitrate at 2GB, and in 16:9 format. If you plan on sending us your own recording, please let us know by Tuesday, September 1, and you must have your recording into us by Friday, September 18. 
Please upload your file into the Google Folder and make sure your file is named in this format: DateOfPresentation_TitleOfPresentation_YourName.mp4
Example: Sep18_This is my title_Jillian Hall.mp4
Email the ONES content team as soon as you have uploaded your video file.

I am scheduled for a 30-minute breakout session, do I need to use all of that time?
No, you aren’t required to speak for the full 30-minutes and we actually recommend planning to speak for about 25 minutes, and leaving 5 minutes for questions. We find that 25 minutes is perfect in keeping attendees attention. 

My session time doesn’t work due to my location. Can I move my session?
Please contact us and we will try to accommodate your request to the best of our ability. Change requests must be made no later than Tuesday, September 1.

What happens if I have to cancel my pre-recording session last minute? Can I reschedule?
Once you reserve a slot to record your session within the INXPO platform, that is final and we are unable to accommodate time swaps and/or rescheduling. Bandwidth is extremely limited and we cannot make scheduling changes. If you have to cancel at the last minute, or do not make your appointment, you will not have another chance to pre-record and you will have to present live the day of the event.

My presentation includes a demo, can I share my screen for that?
Yes, you can share your live screen for a demo. Unfortunately, you cannot switch from your screen share to another camera because if you switch the camera input, it will take away the audio from the computer so we would not be able to hear you.

Will my speaker notes transfer over?
Speaker notes will transfer over but the space allocated for them is small and can be hard to read once your pre-record session starts so we recommend keeping them brief and using short bullets. We also highly recommend either using a second screen next to your monitor or even print out a copy of the notes to have on hand and refer to.

How do I get access to my session?
You will receive a calendar invitation from the Intrado team which will include a personalized link to log-into, and a phone bridge number that you have to dial into. Log-on and dial in 30 Minutes before your session, and the Intrado engineer, and an LF representative, will be in there to get your tech tested and prepare you for the session.
Note for Residents Outside the US & Canada: Underneath the phone bridge information, you will see a line that says, “For additional dial-in numbers, click here.” Just click that, choose your country, and it will give you additional options for call-in numbers local to you – you would still want to use the same conference code, as that is unique to your session.

Pre-recorded Sessions – Within the Platform 

I want to pre-record my session, what do I do now? 
If you are pre-recording within the platform, you will need to book a time to record with an Intrado engineer by filling out this form.
At least 48-hours prior to your recording appointment, you must upload your PowerPoint presentation slides and any accompanying videos into your designated folder:
Go to the Session Recordings FolderFind the folder with the date of your recording appointmentClick on that folder to openLocate the folder with the time of your appointment, open folderUpload your PowerPoint formatted presentation slides and any accompanying videoEmail the ONES content team once you have done the above
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure your presentation is viewable by anyone. The Intrado team will need to be able to see your presentation in order to download and then upload into the platform.
You will receive a calendar invite from Intrado 24-hours before the recording, and this will include the details needed to access the platform and your session. 

Who sends the invite to the recording session?
This invitation will come from a member of the Intrado team. As a reminder, it will come 24 hours before the recording appointment.

What happens in the recording session?
When you log-in via the link you were sent in the calendar invite, you will meet with the engineer for 20 minutes and they will walk you through the system, show you how to advance your slides, and answer any questions you might have. After the thirty minutes, you will be ready to record and the engineer will walk you through the process. You will only have one chance at recording your talk; they cannot stop/restart the recording or edit the recording afterward.

Will you provide any platform training to help us feel more comfortable recording our session?
The engineer will spend 20 minutes reviewing the platform with you and we also recommend that prior to your recording date, you watch the INXPO Studio Speaker & Moderator Training, which provides platform training as well. Note: If the training video fails to load, try loading it in an incognito window.

What presentation format is required?
The platform only supports PowerPoint format. We’ve created an optional presentation template for you to use. 
We understand limiting to PowerPoint as a presentation format is not ideal and apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. If you have any issues with converting your presentation to PowerPoint, please let us know as we are happy to convert your file for you. We do request that if we are converting your slides, you limit it to basic fonts to make it easier for us. If you wish to convert your presentation on your own from PDF, we recommend following Adobe’s instructions on how to convert to PowerPoint. If you are using Google Slides, Keynote, or any other presentation software, we recommend using their built-in export-to-PowerPoint converter and reviewing for any custom text errors before sending your presentation to us.

I want to use slides in my talk. How do I do that?
You will need to send or share your slides with us no later than 48-hours before your session recording so they can be uploaded to the system prior to your recording session. Additionally, do not embed any videos in your slides and send those separately as well. Intrado will upload your slides and videos prior to your recording session and walk you through how it will all work.

I am submitting a .PPT file, what animations and build are supported?

Will my speaker notes transfer over?
Speaker notes will transfer over but the space allocated for them is small, and can be hard to read once your pre-record session starts so we recommend keeping them brief and using short bullets. We highly recommend either using a second screen next to your monitor, or even print out a copy of the notes to have on hand and refer to.

Can I embed videos in my presentation?
Do not embed any videos in your slides and send those separately to us. Intrado will upload any videos prior to your recording session and walk you through how it will all work. Note: The videos must be under 4gb in size.

When do you need my slides and video?
We need to receive your slides by 10:00am Central Daylight Time (CDT) two days BEFORE your recording. Please upload your slide presentation, and any videos into your designated date/time folder:
Go to the Session Recordings FolderFind the folder with the date of your recording appointmentClick on that folder to openLocate the folder with the time of your appointment, open folderUpload your PowerPoint formatted presentation slides and any accompanying videoEmail the ONES content team once you have done the above
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure your presentation is viewable by anyone. The Intrado team will need to be able to see your presentation in order to download and then upload into the platform.

My files are too big to email. How can I get them to you?
Please contact us and we will set-up a Google folder that you can drop them into. If you cannot access Google folders, we will work with you to find a file share service or, put you in touch with a platform team member close to your location who can receive these items. 

What happens if I don’t send my presentation or videos before my recording session?
This means that you will lose about 10 minutes of practice time as the Intrado engineer will have to use that time to upload your slides and get them synced in their system. 

If I make a mistake, will that get edited out?
Unfortunately, there will not be an opportunity to edit the session recording if you make a mistake. People make mistakes, even during presentations. Realize that flubs happen and they won’t derail your presentation – unless you let them. Just keep going in your planned presentation and remember, the audience is forgiving. 

My presentation has more than one speaker. Do we all need to be present at the same time to record the session on the platform?
Yes, you will all need to be present if you choose to pre-record your session. Please note that you do not have to be in the same space, as you will all get links to the session and will join remotely. 

What happens if I have to cancel my pre-recording session last minute? Can I reschedule?
Once you reserve a slot, that is final and we are unable to accommodate time swaps and/or rescheduling. With over 300 sessions, and 475+ speakers, bandwidth is extremely limited and we cannot make scheduling changes. If you have to cancel at the last minute, or do not make your appointment, you will not have another chance to pre-record and you will have to present live the day of the event.

I want to change a slide in my deck before the event, is this possible after I have recorded?
No, we cannot update slide decks after you have recorded your presentation.

Can I edit my slide deck after the event?
Unfortunately, we cannot update decks after the event.


Live Sessions – Tutorials ONLY

I want to present live, what do I do now? 
For tutorial presentations, you will have the option to present live on Zoom. If you prefer this option, you will need to let Jillian Hall know by Tuesday, September 2.
On the day of your presentation, you will log-on about 30 minutes before your session, and a Linux Foundation team member will get you set-up for the live session.
What presentation format is required?
As you can screenshare, you can use whatever slide format you would like. You are welcome to use the optional presentation template, but it is not required.
Who sends the invite?
This invitation for the Zoom session will come from a member of the Linux Foundation team.
How do I get access to my session?
You will receive a calendar invitation from the Intrado team which will include a personalized link to log-into, and a phone bridge number that you have to dial into. Log-on and dial in 30 Minutes before your session, and the Intrado engineer, and an LF representative, will be in there to get your tech tested and prepare you for the session.
Note for Residents Outside the US & Canada: Underneath the phone bridge information, you will see a line that says, “For additional dial-in numbers, click here.” Just click that, choose your country, and it will give you additional options for call-in numbers local to you – you would still want to use the same conference code, as that is unique to your session.
My presentation is a panel and we all reside in different timezones. How can we all be online together for the live presentation?
Each speaker will be sent a link to the panel session. You will all log-on at the designated time, where you will all be connected.
Can I edit my slide deck after the event?
Unfortunately, we cannot update decks after the recording.


Live Q&A 

What is the live Q&A? Why is it important?
We recommend that speakers leave at least 5–10 minutes of their allotted session time to answer questions from attendees which makes the event more interactive and seem less like a webinar. Speakers doing live sessions will do this live and speakers who have pre-recorded, will be able to join their session and answer questions via video, audio, or the text chat function. 

How does the live Q&A work?
As a speaker, you can read the questions in the Q&A Box, prioritize them (high/med/low), and either answer them via text during the pre-recorded session playback or answer them via voice after your live presentation. If you answer them via text, you can opt to make your answer public or private. Only the speakers in the session can see the Q&A Box. If you would like to answer questions via voice or video, the Intrado Engineer in the room will enable the session audio for you and test it when you log into your session 30-minutes early.

I am pre-recording, do I need to participate in the live chat?
Yes. Live Q&A is required as this will provide added value to the audience and create more of an ‘event’ vs a webinar. Please note that your allotted session time should include Q&A and you will be able to answer questions via audio, video, or the live text chat. The exceptions are Lightning Talks and Keynotes. There will not be Q&A with Lightning Talks; Q&A is TBD for Keynotes.

I am presenting live, should I read the questions out loud?
Yes. We recommend that before you answer, you read the question out loud so the audience clearly knows what the question is that you are answering. 

I am pre-recording, how do I let attendees know that it is time for Q&A?
We recommend putting your last slide as “Thank you! Any Questions?” and state in the pre-recording, “Thank you! I am now happy to answer any questions you may have.” Then, you can answer the questions via video, audiot, or text chat. When you pre-record, the engineers will also walk you through best practices to answer questions.

Will attendees see the questions I am receiving?
When attendees submit questions, only the speaker will be able to see them at first and will have the option to publish them. Again, if you are presenting in a live session, we recommend you read the question so that attendees know what question you are answering.

I am unable to participate in a live Q&A session, what do I need to do?
While we recommend you join the live Q&A portion of the event, we will work with you on the best plan to get questions to you. Contact us immediately and we will work with you.
