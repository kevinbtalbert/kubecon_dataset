						Resume Writing Workshop					





Thursday, July 2 | 10:00 – 11:30 am CDTRegistration Cost: Complimentary; No Sign-up Required
Join us for an interactive workshop led by Lindsey Anne Thorne, Managing Director at Vaco, on the do’s and don’ts of writing a technical resume. Extra attention will be placed on showing off and highlighting your open source contributions!
As managing director, Lindsey provides technology and open source solutions for Vaco’s clients. Lindsey built this practice out when she joined in 2012, and the team is committed to the Open-Source Community. Similarly to how open-source software is developed in a collaborative public manner, Lindsey also prides herself on maintaining a transparent and autonomous team to best serve the client’s needs.
Note: You must be registered for OSS+ELC North America Virtual Experience to participate.
