Open Source Summit connects the open source ecosystem under one roof. It covers cornerstone open source technologies; helps ecosystem leaders to navigate open source transformation; and delves into the newest technologies and latest trends touching open source. It is an extraordinary opportunity for cross-pollination between the developers, sysadmins, DevOps professionals, IT architects, and business & community leaders driving the future of technology.
In 2020, Embedded Linux Conference North America combines with Open Source Summit North America for the second time – bringing the important technologies and topics in embedded systems and industrial IoT into the fold.



The leading conference for technologists and open source industry leaders to collaborate and share information, learn about the latest in open source technologies and find out how to gain a competitive advantage by using innovative open solutions.
