EXPLORE THE VIRTUAL SCHEDULE

Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020 is now a Virtual Experience, happening June 29 – July 2 on the US Central Time Zone.
Due to continuing COVID-19 safety concerns, we are transitioning Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux Conference North America to a virtual experience June 29 – July 2 on the US Central Time Zone. 
As our physical event shifts to a virtual one, know that we are taking thoughtful actions to create an immersive digital experience that provides you with interactive content and collaboration experiences. You will have the ability to network with other attendees, attend presentations with live Q&A, interact with sponsors real-time, and much more – all virtually, from anywhere. 
We’re excited to invite you to the reimagined Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020 – a virtual experience where we will continue to shape the future of open source, together. Please visit our FAQ page for more info, explore our full schedule, and make your plans to join us.
Thank you for your patience while we worked through this fluid situation to determine the best path forward.
