Embedded Linux Conference (ELC) has been the premier vendor-neutral technical conference for the past 14 years for companies and developers using Linux in embedded products. In recent years with the increase of industrial IoT uses, ELC has expanded to cover content and collaboration needed to lead successful IoT developments and progress the development of IoT solutions.
ELC gathers system and user space developers, industrial IoT developers and architects, product vendors, and kernel developers for education and collaboration that help pave the way for innovation.



“ELC/OpenIOT Summit was one of the most exciting conferences I’ve been to in recent years, there were far too many interesting talks for me to attend all I wanted and it was a great opportunity to connect with people in the community.”
Mark BrownKernel Working Group Technical Lead, Linaro
