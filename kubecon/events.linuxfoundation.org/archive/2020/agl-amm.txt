				Automotive Grade Linux All Member Meeting			







Due to the COVID-19 coronavirus situation, we have decided to cancel the AGL All Member Meeting Spring 2020 (March 18 – 19 in Honolulu, Hawaii).
We had hoped to be able to hold the event, but in the past few days, we have had numerous companies, attendees and speakers inform us that they cannot attend due to corporate travel restrictions based on COVID-19 related concerns. Although we are disappointed to have to cancel, our first priority is the health and wellbeing of our attendees and community. 
Join us for our next All Member Meeting, July 15-16 in Berlin, Germany!
Contact events@automotivelinux.org with any additional questions.
