OpenPOWER Summit NA 2020 is a wrap! Thank you to all of the attendees, speakers, and sponsors that joined us virtually this year. To experience the best of the event, be sure to watch the keynotes and breakout sessions on the OpenPOWER Foundation YouTube Channel available by September 29. You can also review session slides from speakers who provided them via the event schedule.

OpenPOWER Foundation’s Summit event brings together leaders, members, and contributors of the OpenPOWER community and ecosystem. In 2020, we’re going virtual to learn and engage with the community that is building OpenPOWER silicon, systems, and applications.
