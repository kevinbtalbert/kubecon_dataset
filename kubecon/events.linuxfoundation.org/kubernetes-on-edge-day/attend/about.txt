						About					





Edge Computing will be 4x larger than cloud and will generate 75% of data worldwide by 2025. With hardware and software spread across hundreds or thousands of locations, the only feasible way to manage these distributed systems are the simple paradigms around observability, loosely coupled systems, declarative APIs, and robust automation, that have made cloud native technologies so successful in the cloud. Kubernetes is already becoming a key part of the edge ecosystem, driving integrations and operations. 
Join Kubernetes on Edge at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon to get in on the ground floor and shape the future intersection of cloud native and edge computing.
Who Should AttendKubernetes on Edge brings together developers and adopters across the entire cloud native ecosystem to share their lessons learned in building, breaking, and bettering  their edge infrastructure. Any developer interested in learning how to deploy Kubernetes and cloud native projects at the edge should attend.
