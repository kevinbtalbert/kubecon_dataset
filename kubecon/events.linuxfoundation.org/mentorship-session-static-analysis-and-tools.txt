Join us for Static Analysis & Tools, with Jan-Simon Möller, Release Manager, Automotive Grade Linux.
In this presentation, we will introduce the concept of Static Analysis and how it can help you make your code better. The focus is to use Linux and Open Source Tooling to make it easily reproducible. Finally, we’ll discuss the benefits and use-cases.
The session will begin with an overview by Jan-Simon Möller (45 minutes) and will be followed by Q&A – an opportunity to both ask questions and for group discussion (45 minutes).
