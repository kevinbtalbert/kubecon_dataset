						About					





Cloud Native Logging Day aims to bring developers and users from the Fluent community to discuss, exchange, and share experiences using Fluentd and Fluent Bit. Whether you are a pro operating at petabyte scale or looking to bring more visibility into your Cloud Native environment, we invite you to join the discussion.
Learn from experts operating Fluentd and Fluent Bit to run their observability pipelines and avoid common pitfalls when implementing at scale. Understand how users in the financial, security, and enterprise software space can meet critical performance and privacy requirements with breakout sessions. Get connected and start discussions with other users who are leveraging the project, and help define the project’s evolution in the coming year.
