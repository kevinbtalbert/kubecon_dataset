Education and collaboration are vital to the future of the LF Energy ecosystem, and it is imperative to us that everyone in the community that wants to participate feels welcome to do so regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, dis/ability, race, ethnicity, age, religion or economic status. Our code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.



Scholarships
To encourage and increase the participation of a diverse community, we are pleased to offer diversity and need-based scholarships and discounts, as well as travel funding, to our conferences.
