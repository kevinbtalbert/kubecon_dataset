						About					





Rust is a language empowering everyone to build secure, reliable, and efficient software. Rust is becoming more widely used in cloud native, powering everything from lightning-fast service meshes and powerful developer tools to internet-scale distributed databases.
Come explore what makes Rust a fantastic choice for new cloud native development, and learn about how the community uses Rust today. 
We invite attendees across experience levels and previous languages, and we will have an introductory workshop for those just starting out.
Who should attend?
Developers looking to effectively build & run cloud native Rust applications on Kubernetes. Engineers who want to develop safe, secure, and performant tools & frameworks to support cloud native infrastructure.
We will be featuring a workshop on beginning Rust for cloud native development and a single track of talks.
Location
This is a co-located event with KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 that will be held virtually.
