SPONSORSHIPS CLOSED


Kubernetes Forums in global cities bring together international and local experts with adopters, developers, and practitioners in an accessible and compact format. The Forums are designed to promote face-to-face collaboration and deliver rich educational experiences. At the Forums, attendees can engage with the leaders of Kubernetes and other CNCF-hosted projects and help set direction for the cloud native ecosystem.
Kubernetes Forums allow speakers and sponsors the opportunity to double their cloud native event engagement by hosting two consecutive events in two cities during a single week. Sponsors can reach a broader audience within a condensed timeline, maximizing their engagement efforts with the community on a global scale while saving on travel costs.
Each Kubernetes Forum will be a 2-day program consisting of CFP-based sessions, including a beginner and advanced track (Day 1) and a selection of co-located events (Day 2). To provide convenience to sponsors and speakers, the coupling of forums (ex. Bengaluru & Delhi) will repurpose content. Day 1 will repurpose talks from international speakers, interspersed with new talks from local speakers in each city. On day 2, the co-located events repeat.
In 2020, CNCF is also planning for a Kubernetes Forum in Tokyo on September 17, 2020. Event sponsorships will be similar in price and details in each city.
