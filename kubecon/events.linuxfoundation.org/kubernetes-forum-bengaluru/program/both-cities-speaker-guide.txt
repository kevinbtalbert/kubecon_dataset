Please note that all breakout conference sessions are 25-minutes in duration. If you have a conflict with the timing of your talk or are having problems uploading your bio and photo, please contact Nanci Lancaster at speakers@cncf.io. 
Speaker Cancellation and Session Update Policy
If you need to cancel or update your session, please contact Nanci Lancaster and note the below policy. All requests must be made by Friday, January 31.
If you are on a solo session and are no longer able to attend the conference, your session will be canceled and replaced with a session from the waitlist. Neither you nor your company will be allowed to replace you as a speaker.If you are on a session with one speaker, and would like to add a co-speaker, or, are on a session with two speakers and would like to replace one of the speakers, your replacement or addition request will need to be approved by the chairperson before we are able to add them as a speaker.
If you have any update requests to your session (speaker changes, description updates, etc.), those requests must be made no later than Friday, January 31.



AV Details + Requirements
Any additional AV requests are due by Friday, January 17
The room will include a screen, projector, (1) wireless microphone, and (2) handheld microphones – for a co-speaker and audience Q & A, so be sure to leave time at the end of your talk.
Required: All speakers will need to supply their own computer and necessary adaptors to use during their session. NOTE: The projectors have both VGA and HDMI capabilities/outputs and can accommodate either. If you require any additional AV, please email Nanci Lancaster with those needs by Friday, January 17. CNCF will make every effort to accommodate additional A/V needs; however, final approval for additional A/V requests will be made on a case-by-case basis.



Speaker PowerPoint Presentation Template
We designed optional Kubernetes Forum Bengaluru and Kubernetes Forum Delhi PowerPoint Templates for our speakers. Use of these templates is not required but we do welcome you to use them for your convenience: Bengaluru Template, Delhi Template.
Helpful Notes on Presentation Design
Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of over 1000 cloud native projects, products, and companies are available in the cloud native landscape and the serverless and member landscapes. All logos are in the card mode and can be found with Cmd-F or Cntl-F from your browser. Note that all of these logos are stacked, not horizontal, and include the name. The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they’re not). Also note that the text below the logo shows the proper capitalization of projects like gRPC and containerd. In particular, Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have all changed their logos in the last couple years; please use their current one.Please see the CNCF style guide which covers things like abbreviating Kubernetes as K8s not K8 or K8S.
Presentation Requirements
Upload to Sched.com by Monday, February 10
All breakout speakers are required to upload their final presentation slides ahead of the event. In addition to providing a hard copy for accessibility purposes, we find that adding the presentations before the event helps to drive interest in attending the session.
Please note that your presentation slides should be uploaded in PDF-format to Sched.com and must be formatted in 16:9. 
To upload slides:
Log into your Kubernetes Forum Bengaluru 2020 speaker profile through Sched.comGo to k8sforumbengaluru20.sched.comIn the middle of the page, click “Manage and Promote Your Session”Click “Add Presentation”Click in the “Select a File” box and add the PDF document (note: there is a 50MB size limit)Click “Upload” and your slides will automatically be savedThen, repeat the steps above for Delhi: k8sforumdelhi2020.sched.com

Inclusive Speaker Orientation Online Course
The Linux Foundation, in collaboration with the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT), has created an online course designed to teach the viewer about inclusion, diversity and unconscious bias. It is strongly encouraged by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that all our speakers watch the course to learn tips/tools to use when speaking to encourage inclusivity in presentations and messaging.



Code of Conduct
Please read, and abide by our code of conduct for Bengaluru and Delhi. Our code of conduct is strictly enforced. We ask that speakers especially review this code of conduct and are careful to be inclusive in the words and images used during their presentation.
