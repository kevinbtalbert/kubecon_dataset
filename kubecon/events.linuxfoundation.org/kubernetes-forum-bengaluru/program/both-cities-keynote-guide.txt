Speaker PowerPoint Presentation Template
We designed optional Kubernetes Forum Bengaluru and Kubernetes Forum Delhi PowerPoint Templates for our speakers. Use of these templates is not required but we do welcome you to use them for your convenience: Bengaluru Template, Delhi Template.
Helpful Notes on Presentation Design
Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of over 1000 cloud native projects, products, and companies are available in the cloud native landscape and the serverless and member landscapes. All logos are in the card mode and can be found with Cmd-F or Cntl-F from your browser. Note that all of these logos are stacked, not horizontal, and include the name. The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they‚Äôre not). Also note that the text below the logo shows the proper capitalization of projects like gRPC and containerd. In particular, Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have all changed their logos in the last couple years; please use their current one.Please see the CNCF style guide which covers things like abbreviating Kubernetes as K8s not K8 or K8S.
Final Presentation + Chairperson Meeting
Meet with Chairperson by Friday, January 31
Email final Bengaluru and Delhi presentations to Nanci by Monday, February 10
We strictly enforce a no-pitch, non-advertorial policy for all of our presentations, especially on the keynote stage. Leading up to the event, Davanum ‚ÄúDims‚Äù Srinivas, the chairperson for both Kubernetes Forum Bengaluru and Kubernetes Forum Delhi, will contact you to review your presentation and ensure the messaging resonates with our audience. The deadline to meet with Dims Srinivas is Friday, January 31, and you must have a draft of your presentation at the time of the meeting.Your final Bengaluru and Delhi presentation slides are due by Monday, February 10. You will email them directly to Nanci Lancaster in 16:9, PowerPoint format only.
Keynote Walk-Thru
Bengaluru: Sunday, February 16
Delhi: Wednesday, February 19
All international keynote presenters are required to attend a 10-minute walk-thru of the keynote stage on February 16 in Bengaluru and February 19 in Delhi.This walk-thru will allow you to become familiar with the stage, what to expect on show-day, go over any a/v needs you may have (example: playing a video) and to click through your slides. This is a great opportunity to see if any issues may arise and resolve them ahead of the event.Please keep February 16 and 19 available for these walk-thrus.
You will be assigned walk-thru times closer to the event. If you foresee any issues with attending your walk-thrus, please let Nanci Lancaster know as soon as possible to reschedule.

Inclusive Speaker Orientation Online Course
The Linux Foundation, in collaboration with the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT), has created an online course designed to teach the viewer about inclusion, diversity and unconscious bias. It is strongly encouraged by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that all our speakers watch the course to learn tips/tools to use when speaking to encourage inclusivity in presentations and messaging.



Code of Conduct
Please read, and abide by our code of conduct for Bengaluru and Delhi. Our code of conduct is strictly enforced. We ask that speakers especially review this code of conduct and are careful to be inclusive in the words and images used during their presentation.
