Save the Date!KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual | November 17-20

Originally built at Lyft and now a CNCF graduated project, Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In a short period of time, Envoy has been widely adopted throughout the industry in a variety of different deployment scenarios including edge proxy, “service mesh,” internal middle-proxy load balancer, etc. Envoy’s extensibility, performance, quality, API driven configuration, and community have all been drivers for the rapid growth of the project.
The Envoy maintainers are excited to announce the 3rd annual EnvoyCon, a practitioner-driven community conference that emphasizes end-user case studies as well as deep technical talks from vendors that have chosen to build offerings on top of Envoy (zero product pitches!). Come join us for an exciting day of technical content and networking (both the social and computing kind). Learn more about Envoy.
