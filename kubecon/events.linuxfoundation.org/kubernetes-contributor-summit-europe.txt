				Kubernetes Contributor Summit Europe			










In an effort to give everyone the best Kubernetes Contributor Summit experience possible, we have decided to cancel the European event in order to focus all of our efforts solely on the upcoming Kubernetes Contributor Summit North America, taking place November 16 in Boston, MA.
Additionally, we are hoping to offer our first online New Contributor Workshop this summer, so keep a look out for additional information on how to register to attend.
We look forward to providing a great event in November and hope you can join us then! If you have any questions or concerns please email us at community@kubernetes.io.
